Comparison across different settings with the old model and the new model using brian2.

Landscape(stdE=3., stdI=2.25, connection_probability=.175, params={"size": 4, "base": 1}) compared to stdI 2.3
Starter:
	Old: all increasing, 4->15 (pink), 1->8 (green)
	brian: more sequences than old, but fewer than low_stdI
Repeater: 
	Old: High overall level, slight increase in pink
	brian: shallow increase in pink, shallower than low_stdI
	
	
# synapse = Synapse(weight=.7, EI_factor=6.25)
synapse = Synapse(weight=.7, EI_factor=6.)
landscape = Landscape("Perlin_uniform", stdE=3., stdI=2.25, connection_probability=.175, shift=1., params={"size": 4, "base": 1}, seed=0)
Generally, the g=6 evokes more sequences across the whole network
Starter:
	Steep increase in all cases
Repeater:
	Increase in the pink, but decrease in the green spot
